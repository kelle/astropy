    .. warning::
        In the current version of astropy, the ecliptic frames do not yet have
        stringent accuracy tests.  We recommend you test to "known-good" cases
        to ensure this frames are what you are looking for. (and then ideally
        you would contribute these tests to Astropy!)

    Parameters
    ----------
    representation : `BaseRepresentation` or None
        A representation object or None to have no data (or use the other keywords)
    lon : `Angle`, optional, must be keyword
        The ecliptic longitude for this object (``lat`` must also be given and
        ``representation`` must be None).
    lat : `Angle`, optional, must be keyword
        The ecliptic latitude for this object (``lon`` must also be given and
        ``representation`` must be None).
    distance : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional, must be keyword
        The distance for this object from the {0}.
        (``representation`` must be None).
    copy : bool, optional
        If `True` (default), make copies of the input coordinate arrays.
        Can only be passed in as a keyword argument.
